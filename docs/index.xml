      <description>So you are hosting your git repo in AWS CodeCommit and would like to add some issue tracking / project management to the repo. Currently AWS doesn&amp;rsquo;t offerin/ben-johnston-98085910/ any of its own services and thus we will need to hook in some 3rd party services such as Atlassian&amp;rsquo;s JIRA and GitHub. Connecting JIRA to CodeCommit is reasonably straightforward and if you would like to use AWS CodeStart templates there is good documentation available from both Atlassian as well as in the CodeStar setup process itself.</description>
